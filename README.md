### MAL Analysis

I like collecting data about the shows I watch, particularly what I think about
them in terms of their plot, characters, art, and sound.

These Jupyter notebooks contain tools to download MAL data and provide some
analysis as well.

#### Set Up

You need [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed.

* Optional: create a virtual env

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
